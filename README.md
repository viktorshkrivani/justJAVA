# Introduction to Java â€” Labs & Projects  

This repository contains a series of labs that gradually build Java programming skills â€” starting from the very basics of syntax and input, progressing into control flow, arrays, objects, and file I/O. 


## ðŸ“‘ Table of Contents  

###  Labs  

- **[Lab 1 â€” Introduction to Java, Basic Syntax & I/O](./LAB1/)**  
  First steps with Java: writing a simple program, using `main`, and printing output to the console.  

- **[Lab 2 â€” Variables, Expressions, and Operators](./LAB2/)**  
  Learn how to declare variables, perform calculations, and use operators to manipulate data.  

- **[Lab 3 â€” Control Structures (if/else, loops)](./Lab3/)**  
  Practice decision-making with conditionals and repetition with loops (`for`, `while`).  

- **[Lab 4 â€” Methods and Modular Programming](./LAB4/)**  
  Break code into reusable methods for cleaner, modular design.  

- **[Lab 5â€“6 â€” Arrays and Array Algorithms](./Lab5-6/)**  
  Work with collections of data using arrays, loop through them, and implement basic algorithms.  

- **[Lab 7 â€” Classes and Objects Basics](./LAB7/)**  
  Introduction to object-oriented programming: creating classes, attributes, constructors, and methods.  

- **[Lab 8 â€” File I/O (Reading and Writing Files)](./LAB8%20File%20IO/)**  
  Learn how to persist data using files, read saved input, and process it with Javaâ€™s I/O classes.  

### Projects  
- **[Project 0](./Project0/)** â€” Getting started project (Java basics practice)  
- **[Project 1](./project1/)** â€” Introductory Java project (loops and conditionals)  
- **[Project 2](./Project2/)** â€” Intermediate Java project (arrays and methods)  
- **[Project 3 â€” File I/O](./Project3%20File%20IO/)** â€” Using Java file I/O to process data
