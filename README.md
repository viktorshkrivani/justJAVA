# Introduction to Java â€” Labs & Projects  

This repository contains a series of labs that gradually build Java programming skills  starting from the very basics of syntax and input, progressing into control flow, arrays, objects, and file I/O. 


## ðŸ“‘ Table of Contents  

###  Labs  

- **[Lab 1 â€” Introduction to Java, Basic Syntax & I/O](./LAB1/)**  
  First steps with Java: writing a simple program, using `main`, and printing output to the console.  

- **[Lab 2 â€” Variables, Expressions, and Operators](./LAB2/)**  
  Learn how to declare variables, perform calculations, and use operators to manipulate data.  

- **[Lab 3 â€” Control Structures (if/else, loops)](./Lab3/)**  
  Practice decision-making with conditionals and repetition with loops (`for`, `while`).  

- **[Lab 4 â€” Methods and Modular Programming](./LAB4/)**  
  Break code into reusable methods for cleaner, modular design.  

- **[Lab 5â€“6 â€” Arrays and Array Algorithms](./Lab5-6/)**  
  Work with collections of data using arrays, loop through them, and implement basic algorithms.  

- **[Lab 7 â€” Classes and Objects Basics](./LAB7/)**  
  Introduction to object-oriented programming: creating classes, attributes, constructors, and methods.  

- **[Lab 8 â€” File I/O (Reading and Writing Files)](./LAB8%20File%20IO/)**  
  Learn how to persist data using files, read saved input, and process it with Javaâ€™s I/O classes.  

### Projects  
- **[Project 0 ðŸªš â€” Deck Builder Cost Estimator](./Project0/)**  
  A console program that calculates the number of boards, material costs, labor costs, and discounts for building a deck. It outputs the total estimated project cost.  

- **[Project 1 ðŸŽ® â€” Text Adventure Game](./project1/)**  
  A text-based adventure game where the player can move in directions, attack, sleep to heal wounds, and eventually escape using a secret word. Tracks turns and enforces wounded states.  

- **[Project 2 ðŸš—âš¡ â€” Electric Vehicle Simulator](./Project2/)**  
  A simulation of an electric vehicle that allows the user to check battery status, drive based on distance and efficiency, and charge the battery without overcharging. Includes unit tests for core methods.  

- **[Project 3 ðŸ›’ â€” Shop Management & Kiosk System](./Project3%20File%20IO/)**  
  A shop system with two modes: Manage Shop (add, update, delete items stored in `.txt` files) and Kiosk Mode (customers purchase items, stock updates automatically, and a receipt is generated).
