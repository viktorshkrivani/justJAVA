# Lab: Test Score Average Calculator  

This program calculates the **average score** of multiple tests entered by the user.  


## ðŸ”Ž Explanation  

1. **Imports Scanner**  
   - Uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the keyboard.  

2. **User Input**  
   - First asks how many test scores will be entered.  
   - Uses this number to control how many times the program loops for input.  

3. **Loop (for)**  
   - Iterates once for each test score.  
   - Prompts the user to enter the score for each test.  
   - Adds each score to a running total.  

4. **Calculation**  
   - After the loop, divides the total of all test scores by the number of tests entered.  
   - Casts the division to `double` to ensure a decimal average.  

5. **Output**  
   - Displays the calculated average score.  

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose of this Lab  

This lab demonstrates:  
- Using loops (`for`) to repeat input collection.  
- Accumulating a running total of values.  
- Performing division with type casting for accuracy.  
- Outputting calculated results to the console.
