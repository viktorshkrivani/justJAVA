# Project 0 ðŸªš â€” Deck Builder Cost Estimator  

This project is part of **Introduction to Java**. It is a console program that helps a contractor estimate the **materials, labor, and total cost** of building a deck.  


## What it does  

- **Deck and Board Inputs**  
  - Asks for the **length and width of the deck**.  
  - Asks for the **length and width of the boards** being purchased.  
  - Calculates the total deck area, board area, and the **number of boards required**.  

- **Material Costs**  
  - Prompts for the **price per board**.  
  - Calculates total board cost.  
  - Applies a **bulk discount**:  
    - Over $1000 â†’ 10% off  
    - Over $2000 â†’ 15% off  

- **Labor Costs**  
  - Asks for **hours estimated** and **hourly rate**.  
  - Optionally applies a **customer discount** (percentage) to labor only.  

- **Total Project Cost**  
  - Adds together the discounted board cost and the (possibly discounted) labor cost.  
  - Outputs the **final total**.  


## Concepts Practiced  

- Reading input with `Scanner`.  
- Using **arithmetic operations** for area and cost calculations.  
- Applying **if/else logic** for discounts.  
- Using `Math.ceil()` for rounding up (e.g., board count).  
- Combining multiple inputs and calculations into a single program.  

## Example Flow  

1. Enter deck dimensions (length & width).  
2. Enter board dimensions.  
3. Program calculates deck area, board area, and number of boards.  
4. Enter price per board â†’ material cost is shown (with discounts if applicable).  
5. Enter estimated hours & hourly cost â†’ labor cost calculated (with optional discount).  
6. Program prints the **total deck project cost**.
